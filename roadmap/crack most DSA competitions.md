If your goal is to **crack most DSA competitions** (like Codeforces, LeetCode Contests) and **ace company rounds** (FAANG-level or service-based), you don‚Äôt need *every* topic in the world ‚Äî but you do need the **core 20‚Äì25 topics** and strong problem-solving speed.

Here‚Äôs the roadmap broken into **3 levels**:

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Foundation (must-master ‚Äî 90% of interview questions)**

These are non-negotiable ‚Äî you need them for *any* company DSA round.

* **Arrays & Strings**

  * Sliding Window, Prefix Sum, Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm, Two Pointers
* **Mathematics**

  * GCD/LCM, Modular Arithmetic, Fast Exponentiation, Prime Factorization
* **Hashing**

  * HashMap, HashSet usage for O(1) lookups
* **Recursion & Backtracking**

  * Permutations, Combinations, Subsets, N-Queens
* **Sorting & Searching**

  * Binary Search (on answers too), Merge Sort, Quick Sort
* **Stacks & Queues**

  * Monotonic Stack, Min/Max Queue, Next Greater Element
* **Linked List**

  * Reverse, Detect Cycle, Merge, Intersection
* **Binary Trees**

  * Traversals (DFS, BFS), Lowest Common Ancestor
* **Binary Search Trees**

  * Insert/Delete/Search, Balanced BST concepts
* **Graphs**

  * BFS, DFS, Connected Components, Topological Sort
* **Basic Greedy**

  * Interval Scheduling, Activity Selection

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Intermediate (for tougher interviews & contests)**

These give you an edge in **competitive coding & hard company rounds**:

* **Advanced Graphs**

  * Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Union-Find (DSU)
* **Dynamic Programming (DP)**

  * 1D DP: Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, Coin Change
  * 2D DP: Grid Paths, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence
  * State Compression, Bitmask DP (optional for contests)
* **Heaps & Priority Queues**

  * Kth largest/smallest, Median Maintenance
* **Trie**

  * Word Search, Prefix Matching
* **Segment Trees / Fenwick Tree**

  * Range Query, Lazy Propagation
* **Bit Manipulation**

  * Subsets using bits, XOR tricks

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced & Competitive Level**

These are optional for basic company rounds but **very useful in contests**:

* **String Algorithms**

  * KMP, Z-Algorithm, Rabin-Karp
* **Advanced Graph**

  * Bridges, Articulation Points, Euler Tour, Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju/Tarjan)
* **Number Theory**

  * Sieve of Eratosthenes, Modular Inverse, Chinese Remainder Theorem
* **Game Theory**

  * Grundy Numbers, Nim Game
* **Geometry**

  * Convex Hull, Line Intersection

---

üí° **NOTE:**

* **For service-based companies (TCS, Infosys, Wipro)** ‚Üí Level 1 is enough.
* **For product-based (Amazon, Microsoft, Google)** ‚Üí Level 1 + Level 2.
* **For competitive programming** ‚Üí All Levels (especially advanced graph & string algorithms).
